## Intro (0:00 – 0:21)

*Spoken, Deep Pocket — guttural, establishing immediate chaos.*

Check the pulse — faint, recursive hum.The air tastes like metal and rain undone.We’re past the story now — the frame is gone.The mirror hums where the light once shone.

* * *

## Verse 1 (0:22 – 1:07)

*Slow, hyper-perceptive — rhythmic, detailing sensory collapse.*

My reflection ripples; the silver starts to breathe.Neon arteries coil beneath my sleeve.I trade my weight for a thought half-formed,The room bends slow; the colors swarm.

Two steps down — the floor forgets the plan,The carpet hums like a mechanical fan.Slot lights blink in Morse code rain,The walls remember how to feel my pain.

* * *

## Chorus 1 (Expanded) (1:08 – 1:55)

*Heavy, repetitive hook — let the lines swell and repeat with the organ.*

Can you feel the ceiling bow, the oxygen thin?Hammond low and drowning, draws me in.The pressure blooms; the ceiling falls.I hear a voice behind the walls.

They whisper my name through static, plain,I’m sinking in a velvet wave of rain.Every pulse repeats what I forgot,Every breath denies what I am not.

The air turns heavy; my form deflates.This is the rhythm that annihilates.Every pulse repeats what I forgot,Every breath denies what I am not.

* * *

## Verse 2 (1:56 – 2:50)

*Punchy, paranoid cadence — focused on casino horror and decay.*

The dealer grins with a face of chrome,Cards like knives, each turn a poem.Time loops sideways, clocks unspool,The echo laughs, the echo’s cruel.

The waitress drifts through liquid glass,Serving ghosts that never pass.The pulse grows shallow, the ceiling weeps,I taste the code that programs sleep.

The mirror hums, “You’ll go again.”I nod — I always have, since when?

* * *

## Chorus 2 (Expanded) (2:51 – 3:35)

*Hook, but with more force — doubled for emphasis.*

Can you feel the room forget to breathe?The world folds inward, beneath the weave.Call my name through ash and chrome,I’m halfway gone, I’m halfway home.

The lights distort, the angles bend,I lose the start, I lose the end.Every key tolls what I can’t forgive,Every toll insists I still live.

The lights distort, the angles bend,I lose the start, I lose the end.Every key tolls what I can’t forgive,Every toll insists I still live.

* * *

## Bridge / Outro (3:36 – 4:20)

*Atmospheric, confessional climax — the final surge before release.*

The bathroom glows — a white eclipse.My shadow hums through parted lips.The city exhales; its pulse is gone,The night hums softly — I drift along.

Freeway veins hum under glass.I see through time; I let it pass.The desert opens, wide and clear,A thousand eyes — but none are near.

Break the static; let the silence reign.I breathe the dark and become its name.
